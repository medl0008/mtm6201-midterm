        About Us:
        Kneading Love is a local, family-owned business
        based in Ottawa, Ontario. What started as a 
        passion during my maternity leave, has grown into 
        a diverse, creative bakery experience, that offers
        unique and eccentric delicacies perfect for any occasion.
        
        We offer a wide-variety of treats, sweets, and delicacies perfect
        for any occasion and any hungry tummy. Our products meet the 
        expectations of any event, whether it is a birthday, divorce party,
        or simply just the desire for something sweet and baked to perfection.
        
        We offer in-store, over the phone, and online ordering. Check out our
        product section to see how we can satisfy your sweet tooth, as well as
        your loved ones, co-workers, or anyone in your life who 'kneads' the
        perfect dessert.
